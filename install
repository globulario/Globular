Welcome to globular, I will explain how to install and configure your Globule. The first step is to download
globular for the platform you want. You have the choice to install globular on linux (amd64 or arm64) or on
docker.

Linux Installation
From the directory, where the .deb package is, run the following command

    sudo apt install ./globular-VERSION.deb 

that will install globular at /usr/local/share/globular. By default globular will be install as a service and
the service will be started. There is a list of command to manage the globular service.

    sudo service Globular stop
    sudo service Globular start
    sudo service Globular restart

    or 

    sudo systemctl stop Globular
    sudo systemctl start Globular
    sudo systemctl restart Globular

To disable Globular after restart,

    sudo systemclt disable service 
    sudo systemclt enable service

To uninstall Globular service 

    sudo systemctl stop Globular
    cd /usr/local/share/globular
    sudo ./Globular uninstall

Globular need ffmpeg to convert all video in mp4 h.264 in that way all video will be able to be stream to any web-browser.
If you have a nvidia GPU follow the steps decribe at https://docs.nvidia.com/video-technologies/video-codec-sdk/ffmpeg-with-nvidia-gpu
other wise install ffmpeg

    sudo apt install -y ffmpeg

Globular also made use of youtube-dl to download content of various website, to install it,

    sudo apt install python3.8
    sudo apt install python-is-python3
    sudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
    sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl

Now optionaly I recommand to install those package to give remote access to your server,

    sudo apt install nano
    sudo apt install openssh-server
