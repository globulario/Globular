Welcome to globular, I will explain how to install and configure your Globule. The first step is to download
globular for the platform you want. You have the choice to install globular on linux (amd64 or arm64) or on
docker.

Linux Installation
From the directory, where the .deb package is, run the following command

    sudo apt install ./globular-VERSION.deb 

that will install globular at /usr/local/share/globular. By default globular will be install as a service and
the service will be started. There is a list of command to manage the globular service.

    sudo service Globular stop
    sudo service Globular start
    sudo service Globular restart

    or 

    sudo systemctl stop Globular
    sudo systemctl start Globular
    sudo systemctl restart Globular

To disable Globular after restart,

    sudo systemclt disable service 
    sudo systemclt enable service

To uninstall Globular service 

    sudo systemctl stop Globular
    cd /usr/local/share/globular
