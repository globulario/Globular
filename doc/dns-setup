Here I will explain how to setup your own dns server.

The first step is to install a new globular instance.

To upload your globular .deb file on the dns you can made use of scp command,

    sudo scp -i "ns1.mycelius.com.pem" /tmp/globular_2022_01_02/globular_1.0.0-1.0.1_amd64.deb  ubuntu@ec2-204-236-131-178.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/

Now you must name the server with the correct hostname

    sudo nano /etc/hostname
        ns1
    ctrl-s 
    ctll-x

    sudo nano /etc/hosts
        
Next you must change the /etc/globular/config/config.json file values.
    
    Protocol:"https"
    PortHttp: 80
    PortHttps: 443
    Name: "globule-ryzen"
    Domain: "globular.cloud"
    NS : ["ns1.globular.io", "ns2.globular.io"]

And finaly you must free up the port 53

1 - edit the file /etc/systemd/resolved.conf

    sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf

    [Resolve]
    DNS=1.1.1.1
    #FallbackDNS=
    #Domains=
    #LLMNR=no
    #MulticastDNS=no
    #DNSSEC=no
    #DNSOverTLS=no
    #Cache=no
    DNSStubListener=no
    #ReadEtcHosts=yes

2- Create a symbolic link for /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf with /etc/resolv.conf as the destination:

sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


reboot the server

    sudo reboot

You now have a running dns service

to test on your local network simply run de command: 

dig @192.168.0.166 globular.cloud

or on the internet

dig @8.8.8.8 globular.cloud

don't forget to open the port 53 in you firewall and also add a rule to redirect to for exemple 192.168.0.166 and port 53 in port fowarding rules.

and voila you are master of your domain!
